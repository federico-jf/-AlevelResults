The #AlevelResults Case: Visualizing Social Networks and Text Mining on Twitter Data
#Context of the research questions: The #AlevelResults case 
Every year in the United Kingdom, “Level A” exams are taken by young people to determine which university they can aspire to. However, this year such exams were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the school lockdowns. Instead, teachers were asked to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within their class so that posteriorly an algorithm only adjusted and standardized them at the national level.
With the purpose of calculating the final grades, the algorithm of the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (named "Ofqual") used the historical performance of schools and the ranking of students within their own school. 
The result was that 37% of estimated grades were lowered and 5.3% were raised by Ofqual's algorithm in comparison with teachers' predictions. The unexpected effect was that the algorithm ended up benefitting private schools over public schools; results favored those students who were enrolled in better schools even if their grades were worse, compared to those in schools with historically worse performance. This meant that, in some cases, bright pupils in poorly performing schools saw their grades lowered because last year’s cohort of pupils didn’t do well in their exams.
It is evident that such a situation has an impact on the future life of students since it conditions the higher education institutions they can access and limits their opportunities for social mobility.
As soon as the results were known on past August 13, the demonstrations of students, teachers, and educational institutions on social networks did not wait. Mainly on Twitter with the hashtag #AlevelResults, comments about lack of consistency, the erratic and disconcerting character of the results, and anomalies in the construction of the model used by Ofqual were just some of the main public manifestations.
As corollary, in the face of media pressure, the UK government ended up discarding the A levels results corrected by the algorithm and established a plan of future evaluations and appeals to mitigate the biased results.
Seen in perspective, the "#AlevelResults" case is one of the first times that public opinion has spoken out so strongly about results considered unfair coming from evaluations driven by algorithms in educational settings. Undoubtedly, the analysis of such data can be a great opportunity to explore the reaction and arguments offered by students and teachers in this class of situations that will surely become more and more frequent in the near future.
#Research Questions
The general objective is to explore data from Twitter with the hashtag #AlevelResults in order to produce visualizations about the social network and about the content of the published tweets.
Specifically, the main questions that will be addressed are:
• How has the reaction around #AlevelResults on Twitter developed in time?
• From which geographic locations did users participate?
• What is the network or sub-community that most participates in the discussion (tweets with responses and interactions)?
• Who are the top users involved in the discussion around #AlevelResults on Twitter?
• What feelings are associated with the texts published in the tweets?
